Problem Set I
1) How many unique genera are in the Miocene, Early Jurassic, Late Cretaceous, and Pennsylvanian epochs (not total, each)? What code did you use to find out?
#Find dimensions of PresencePBDB
> dim(PresencePBDB)
[1]  29 903
#Isolate the 21st row, sum all of the 1’s in 903 columns; Miocene
> sum(PresencePBDB[21, 1:903]==1)
[1] 603
#repeat for Early Jurassic
> sum(PresencePBDB[29, 1:903]==1)
[1] 84
#Late Cretaceous
>> sum(PresencePBDB[16, 1:903]==1)
[1] 375
#Pennsylvanian
> sum(PresencePBDB[1, 1:903]==1)
[1] 133
2) How many geologic epochs in general are in this dataset? What code did you use to find out?

3) Which epochs contain specimens of the genus Mytilus? What code did you find out.

        Pliocene   Early Triassic 
              27               29 


4) Look at the epochs in the geologic timescale. Using your answer to question 3, in which epochs can we infer that Mytilus was present, even though we have no record of them in the Paleobiology Database? How did you deduce this?
We can infer that Mytilus was present in the epochs from Late Silurian (Pridoli) until the Pleistocene. We deduce this because if it exists in an early epoch, and was found in sediments of later epochs then it must have existed everywhere in-between since an organism cannot experience a true extinction only to reappear in later sediments. 
Problem Set II
The Jaccard index is the simplest Similarity index. It is the intersection of two samples divided by the union of two samples. In other words, the number of genera shared between two samples, divided by the total number of (unique) genera in both samples. Or put even another way, it is the percentage of genera shared between two samples.
1) Using your own custom R code, find the Jaccard similarity of the Pleistocene and Miocene "samples" in your PresencePBDB matrix. It is possible to code this entirely using only functions discussed in the R Tutorial. The key is to use apply( ), sum( ), table( ), and judicious use of matrix subscriptng.
> MiocenePleistocene<-PresencePBDB[c(21,23), ]
> MiocenePleistoceneTrue<-which(apply(MiocenePleistocene,2,sum) == 2)
> length(MiocenePleistoceneTrue)
[1] 510

> MiocenePleistocene1<-which(apply(MiocenePleistocene,2,sum) == 1)
> length(MiocenePleistocene1)
[1] 106

> a<-length(MiocenePleistoceneTrue)
> b<-length(MiocenePleistocene1)
> S<-a/(a+b)
> S
[1] 0.8279221

2) How can you convert your similarity index into a distance?

> 1-S
[1] 0.1720779


3) Install and load the vegan package into R. Read the help file for the vegdist function - ?vegdist or help(vegdist). You must have already loaded the vegan package in order for it to run.
Again, calculate the jaccard distance of the "Miocene" and "Pleistocene" samples of PresencePBDB, but this time use the vegdist( ) function. This should be an identical answer to what you got in question 2.
> vegdist(PresencePBDB[c(21,23), 1:903], method="jaccard", binary=FALSE, na.rm = FALSE)
                      Miocene
Pleistocene 0.1720779
4) Using the vegdist( ) function. Calculate the Jaccard distances of all the following epochs in PresencePBDB - the "Pleistocene", "Pliocene", "Miocene", "Oligocene", "Eocene", "Paleocene". What code did you use? Which two epochs are the most dissimilar?
#Jaccard
> vegdist(PresencePBDB[c(15,19,20,21,27,23), 1:903], method="jaccard", binary=FALSE, na.rm = FALSE)
                        Eocene  Paleocene  Oligocene    Miocene   Pliocene
Paleocene   0.33385827                                            
Oligocene   0.19063005 0.41042345                                 
Miocene     0.08585056 0.33333333 0.16065574                      
Pliocene    0.13397129 0.37914692 0.18968386 0.08496732           
Pleistocene 0.21870048 0.44444444 0.26910299 0.17207792 0.12692967


Problem Set III
1) Create a subset of the PresencePBDB matrix which contains just the following rows - "Pliocene", "Oligocene", "Paleocene", "Early Cretaceous", "Late Jurassic", and "Middle Jurassic". Name this subset RandomEpochs. Show your code.
> RandomEpochs<-PresencePBDB(c[27,20,19,17,14,18], )
> class(RandomEpochs)
[1] "matrix"
2) Using vegdist( ) find the dissimilarities of all the epochs in Random Epochs. Show your code.
> vegdist(RandomEpochs[ , ], method="jaccard", binary=FALSE, na.rm = FALSE)
                                  Pliocene Oligocene Paleocene Early Cretaceous Late Jurassic
Oligocene                        0.1896839                                                   
Paleocene                        0.3791469 0.4104235                                         
Early Cretaceous         0.7462908 0.7480315 0.6400742                               
Late Jurassic                    0.8652695 0.8653846 0.7902622        0.4703947              
Middle Jurassic          0.8852459 0.8814103 0.7931689        0.4883721     0.2962963


3) Find the two epochs that are the most dissimilar and make them the poles. Now, using the dissimilarities, order (ordinate) the remaining epochs based on their similarity to the poles. State the order of your inferred gradient.
The two epochs that are the most dissimilar are the two that share the largest values. These are the Pliocene and the Middle Jurassic (0.885).
Middle Jurassic
Late Jurassic
Early Cretaceous
Paleocene
Oligocene
Pliocene
The preferred gradient is age.
4) Can you deduce what "variable" is controlling this gradient (e.g., temperature, water depth, geographic distance)? [Hint: Check the geologic timescale]. State your reasoning.
I think that the variable controlling this gradient is temperature because in the Jurassic and particularly the Cretaceous there are strong green/hot-house conditions and as time progresses the climate gradually cools moderately in the Eocene until it enters ice-house conditions in the Pliocene.
5). There is a relatively high dissimilarity between the Early Cretaceous and Paleocene epochs. Can you hypothesize why this is? Google these epochs if you need to.
Yes! This probably has to do with a change in climate and environment since the K/Pg impact at the end of the Cretaceous would have resulted in many changes. Organisms living in the Paleocene had to adapt to conditions that changed very quickly and drastically from the Early Cretaceous, and this is what could have resulted in such a high dissimilarity. 
Problem Set IV
1) Download a dataset from the paleobioogy database of all Ordovician aged animals (i.e., animalia) into R, and name the object Ordovician. This may take a few minutes. What R code did you use?
>Ordovician<-downloadPBDB(Taxa=c("Animalia"),StartInterval="Ordovician",StopInterval="Ordovician")
2) Clean up the poorly resolved genus names. What function/code did you use?
> Ordovician<-cleanGenus(Ordovician)
3) Turn your object Ordovician into a community matrix of samples by genera, where the samples are different geoplate codes. Geoplate codes denote different ancient paleocontinents - i.e., your community matrix will list which genera were present in which ancient paleocontinent. Cull this matrix so that each sample has a minimum of 25 taxa and each taxon occurs in at least two samples. Show your code.
> LocationOrdovician<-presenceMatrix(Ordovician,SampleDefinition="geoplate")
>LocationOrdovician<-cullMatrix(LocationOrdovician,minOccurrences=2,minDiversity=25)
4) Perform a DCA on your new community matrix. Analyze your new DCA with a plot. Do you think that the orientation of samples along either axis 1 or axis 2 is related to the average latitude or longitude of each plate in question? Explain how you figured this out. Show your code. [Hint: Information about the paleolatitude and paleolongitude of different geoplates is included in your originally downloaded data - i.e., the object Ordovician.]
> #performing DCA
> OrdovicianDCA<-decorana(LocationOrdovician,ira=0)
> #plot the DCA
> plot(OrdovicianDCA,display="sites")
> Ordovician[1:5,c("geoplate","paleolat","paleolng")]
#find the mean of paleolat and paleolng
> tapply(Ordovician[ ,"paleolat"],Ordovician[ ,"geoplate"], mean)
> tapply(Ordovician[ ,"paleolng"],Ordovician[ ,"geoplate"], mean)
The graph shows very high negative plaeolatitude valaues for the positive x-axis which signals that these were high southern-latitude locations. The negative x-axis appears to represent more tropical mid-latitudes and the y-axis appears to represent latitudes in-between the very low tropical and high polar latitudes.
